                        Hello, I'm Hilario Mendez but you can call me Lar. I am Junior in Computer Science.
                        I have been intrigued by computers ever since my family in Kansas got their first one back
                        in middle school. That curiosity got me my first office job working on a manufacturing
                        company's website and shipping their online sales when I was in high school. And before I
                        knew it, I was here at UNO taking a ton of computer classes getting this degree!
